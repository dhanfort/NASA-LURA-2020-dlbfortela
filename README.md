## MAVEN Spacecraft Case Study
This LURA project demonstrates the use of Machine Learning techniques in analyzing curated NASA datasets, which are the MAVEN datatsets as demo datsets for this project. Of particular time-period of interest are the weeks of May 15, 2018 to June 30, 2018 due to several occurences of dust storms that started from local episodes and expanded to global phenomena.
